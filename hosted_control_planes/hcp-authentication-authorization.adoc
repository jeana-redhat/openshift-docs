You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_installing-aws-network-customizations[Creating AWS resources with a single command].

* If you need to review the JSON files that the `ccoctl` tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-individually_installing-aws-network-customizations[Creating AWS resources individually].
