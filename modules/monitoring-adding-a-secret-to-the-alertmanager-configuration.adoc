= Adding a secret to the Alertmanager configuration

You can add secrets to the Alertmanager configuration for core platform monitoring components by editing the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` project.
You can add secrets to the Alertmanager configuration for user-defined projects by editing the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.

After you add a secret to the config map, the secret is mounted as a volume at `/etc/alertmanager/secrets/<secret_name>` within the `alertmanager` container for the Alertmanager pods.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components in the `openshift-monitoring` project*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map.
** You have created the secret to be configured in Alertmanager in the `openshift-monitoring` project.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the secret to be configured in Alertmanager in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.

.Procedure

. To add a secret configuration to Alertmanager for core platform monitoring, edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add a `secrets:` section under `data/config.yaml/alertmanagerMain`.

. Add the configuration details for the secret in this section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      secrets: <1>
      - <secret_name_1> <2>
      - <secret_name_2>
----
<1> This section contains the secrets to be mounted into Alertmanager.
The secrets must be located within the same namespace as the Alertmanager object.
<2> The name of the `Secret` object that contains authentication credentials for the receiver.
If you add multiple secrets, place each one on a new line.
+
The following sample config map settings configure Alertmanager to use two `Secret` objects named `test-secret-basic-auth` and `test-secret-api-token`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      secrets:
      - test-secret-basic-auth
      - test-secret-api-token
----

. Optional: To add the secrets for use by Alertmanager in user-defined projects, add the secret names under `data/config.yaml/alertmanager/secrets` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanager:
      enabled: true
      secrets:
      - test-secret
      - test-api-receiver-token
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes to the `ConfigMap` object.
The new configuration is applied automatically.
