= Machine sets that support using an Elastic Fabric Adapter

You can use machine sets to create compute machines that use an link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html[Elastic Fabric Adapter] (EFA) as their primary network interface.

[NOTE]
====
Control plane machines cannot use an EFA as their primary network interface.

For more information about instance types that support using an EFA, see the Amazon EC2 documentation about https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html#efa-instance-types[supported instance types].
