[id="capi-yaml-infrastructure-rhosp_{context}"]
= Sample YAML for a Cluster API infrastructure cluster resource on {rh-openstack}

The infrastructure cluster resource is provider-specific and defines properties that are shared by all the compute machine sets in the cluster, such as the region and subnets.
The compute machine set references this resource when creating machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only the parameters in the following example are validated to be compatible with {product-title}.
Other parameters, such as those documented in the upstream link:https://cluster-api-openstack.sigs.k8s.io/clusteropenstack/configuration#optional-configuration({cap-openstack-first}) book, might cause undesired behavior.

----
<1> Specify the infrastructure kind for the cluster.
This value must match the value for your platform.
<2> Specify the cluster ID as the name of the cluster.
<3> Specify the IP address of the control plane endpoint and the port used to access it.
<4> Specify the UUID of the default network to use for machines that do not specify ports.
+
[NOTE]
====
This feature might be removed in a future release.
To prevent issues due to the removal of this feature, specify at least one port in the machine specification instead of relying on this feature.
====

<5> Specify the UUID of an external network.
You can specify the network used to assign external floating IP addresses or the network used for egress for this field.
+
[NOTE]
====
The infrastructure cluster resource requires this field but does not currently use this value.
This requirement is planned to be removed in a future release.
