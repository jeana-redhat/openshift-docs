= Moving resources to infrastructure machine sets

Some of the infrastructure resources are deployed in your cluster by default. You can move them to the infrastructure machine sets that you created by adding the infrastructure node selector in the following format:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  nodePlacement:
    nodeSelector: # <1>
      matchLabels:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    tolerations: # <2>
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    - effect: NoExecute
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
# ...
----
<1> Add a `nodeSelector` parameter with the appropriate value to the component you want to move. You can use a `nodeSelector` in the format shown or use `<key>: <value>` pairs, based on the value specified for the node.
<2> If you added a taint to the infrastructure node, you must add a matching toleration.

Applying a specific node selector to all infrastructure components causes {product-title} to schedule those workloads on nodes with that label.
