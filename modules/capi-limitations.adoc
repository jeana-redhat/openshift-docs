= Cluster API limitations

Using the Cluster API to manage machines is a Technology Preview feature and has the following limitations:

* Only {aws-full}, {gcp-full}, and {vmw-full} clusters can use the Cluster API.

* To use this feature, you must enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set.
Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates.

* You must create the primary resources that the Cluster API requires manually.
For more information, see "Getting started with the Cluster API".

* You cannot use the Cluster API to manage control plane machines.

* Migration of existing compute machine sets created by the Machine API to Cluster API compute machine sets is not supported.

* Full feature parity with the Machine API is not available.
